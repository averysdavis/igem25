          <h1>Abstract</h1>
          <p>
            Microplastics are increasingly widespread, and are now found in the environment, the food chain, and the human body. Although the full extent of the impacts of microplastics are unknown, research indicates that they increase the likelihood of heart attack, stroke, or death. The need to fully remove microplastics from the environment has never been more urgent. At the same time, the U.S. Geological Survey reports that 1 billion tons of limestone are quarried yearly in the United States alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team aims to address both of these issues by engineering E. coli to co-express plastic-binding curli fibers and a biomineralization pathway, effectively capturing microplastics in in situ limestone formations. In particular, we have tested two different microbially induced calcite precipitation pathways (MICP) for biomineralization: a carbonic anhydrase catalyzed pathway and a urease catalyzed pathway. Our resulting aggregate could be utilized to both immobilize harmful microplastics and replace non-renewable resources like sand for construction and backfilling projects.  
          </p>
          <p>
            For each path we successfully developed ODE based software tools to model levels of CaCO3 production of both pathways based on concentrations of each component.  We were able to generate samples of biomineralized solids using a urease based pathway around sand with microplastic contamination utilizing S.pasteurii, a natural biomineralizing bacteria. Additionally, we were able to diagnose protein expression issues with a curli and carbonic anhydrase fusion protein - with the issue lying in the protein transport or oligomerization stage, providing a path forward for successful protein expression. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the process, we consulted with over 10 experts in the field, ran classes and workshops with over 150 students, and translated materials into over 4 languages. We hope to not only create a synthetic biology solution, but to effectively integrate said solution into the community through both education and outreach. 
          </p>

          <h1>Issue</h1>
          <p>  
            With microplastics now found in human bloodstreams, brains and the food chain, the need for synthetic biology solutions like ours has never been more urgent. Jambeck et al. (2015) finds that 5 to 12 million tons of plastic enter the ocean yearly, decomposing into microplastics and harming both the environment and humans. In San Francisco Bay alone, an estimated 7.2 trillion microplastic particles enter annually through urban stormwater runoff, which is equivalent to enough particles to carpet the Golden Gate Bridge three times over each year (Ross et al., 2023). Efforts that recollect plastics from the environment often end up in landfills and wastewater treatments, where the microplastics leak back into the environment (Landfills as a Major Point Source for Microplastic Pollution, n.d.). These microplastics then wreak havoc in a number of ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            Microplastics in the environment have a drastic impact, Zhu et al. (2025) finds that current exposure to microplastics is responsible for a 7 to 12% reduction in photosynthesis across global terrestrial plants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, microplastics travel up the food chain ending up in the human body. “Plastics love fats, or lipids, so one theory is that plastics are hijacking their way with the fats we eat which are then delivered to the organs that really like lipids — the brain is top among those” says Matthew Campen, Regents’ Professor and professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. A 2024 study he coauthored found that across 12 autopsy samples, microplastics made up an average of 0.48% brain mass, 50% higher than samples taken earlier in 2016 (Nihart et al., 2025).
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, the Willett and U.S. Geological Survey (2024) reports that 1 billion tons of limestone are quarried yearly in the United States alone.

          <h1>Current Solutions</h1>
          <p>
            A number of solutions exist for microplastic capture, a few of which we elaborate on here. “Microcleaners”, developed by Haeleen Hong et al. at NC State, comprised of soft dendritic colloids (SDC) have been used as an efficient method for finding, collecting, and removing microplastics from oceans when filtration and centrifugation weren’t enough. The microcleaners work by being concentrated into “pellet” agglomerates and were given the ability to self-propel via releasing surface active compounds, inducing propulsion through the Marangoni effect. While traveling across the water, the microcleaners coil then disperse the SDC, which then sediments and “captures” the microplastics, and the two combined perform transverse active motion and float up to the surface.
          </p>
          <p>
            A number of companies have even commercialized microplastic binding solutions, such as <a href="https://www.polygonesystems.com/">Polygone Systems</a> which uses such methods for water filtration and <a href="https://www.seabin.io/home">Seabin</a>, which runs on funding from company donors.  A common thread is that while a number of companies are able to capture microplastics, few companies describe solutions to handle microplastics after their capture.  
          </p>
          <p>
            The best solutions currently present for handing plastics after collection tend to involve some kind of plastic degradation of recycling. For instance Yip et al. (2024) describes microbial solutions to break down Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) is one of the most common plastics used today. Though thought to be non-biodegradable, there are actually some microbes and insects that are able to metabolize these plastics and turn them into energy sources, though the process is slow. Solutions to recycle individual plastics eg. PET and HDPE do exist and are often used (Almack, 2023). 
          </p>
          <p>
            The issue comes in due to the specificity and purity of plastics to be recycled in these systems. Yip et al. (2024) notes that PET is identified as being more susceptible to biodegradation than most plastics due to hydrolysable ester bonds. The same problem exists with recycling. While select individual polymers of plastics, like PET and HDPE are recycled if pure, mixed plastics and even other common polymers like polypropylene are rarely, if ever recycled (Almack, 2023). 
          </p>
          <p>
            This creates a disconnect between systems that collect mixed plastics like Seabin and Polygone, and forms of plastics disposal, which we hope to bridge with our project.

            We experiment with two existing pathways for microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) for biomineralization, a carbonic anhydrase-catalyzed pathway and a urease-catalyzed pathway. While Carbonic Anhydrase has the benefit of not producing ammonium byproducts, urease is known to produce greater quantities of mineralization.

            The resulting product created by our engineered E. coli can then replace non-renewable resources like sand for construction and backfilling projects. We intend for our solution to be used on microplastics captured by groups like Seabin and Polygone, removing the risk factor of releasing genetically modified E.coli to the wild.

          <h1>Impacts</h1>
          <p>
            We can estimate the potential impact of our solution by seeing what similar systems have accomplished within nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most soil microplastics (MPs) stay near the surface where roots and fauna interact with them, which makes immobilization a high-leverage fix. Enzyme-driven biomineralization has been used to turn that risk into a sink. With utilizing carbonic anhydrase (CA), researchers precipitated CaCO₃ that biocements soil—raising unconfined compressive strength up to ~1 MPa while adding ~2.8% CaCO₃, with SEM/Raman-confirmed calcite coatings that can encapsulate particulates (Mwandira et al., 2024). By closing pore throats, biocementation slashes permeability (reports up to ~98% reduction), curbing vertical migration and runoff vectors for MPs (Arab et al., 2021). Mechanistically, CA routes do not rely on urea hydrolysis, avoiding the ammonium by-products characteristic of urease-based EICP (Gilmour et al., 2024; Arias et al., 2025). In short: locking MPs into a CaCO₃ matrix  is already a known solution that reduces microplastic exposure dramatically—turning contaminated topsoil from a vector into a stable sink.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being able to prevent microplastics being released into the environment has the potential to make a big impact. 
          </p>
          <h2>Environmental:</h2>
          <p>
            Zhu et al. (2025) finds that a 13% reduction in total microplastics could reduce photosynthetic losses by nearly 30% generating an additional 22.15 to 115.73 MT·y−1 in crop production. Such an increase in photosynthesis, if extended across all forest biomass, would serve to remove approximately an additional 230 million metric tons of CO2 from the environment (Harris et al., 2021). This equates to a 0.5% reduction in global CO2 emissions per year (World Meteorological Organization, 2024). 
          </p>
          <h2>Human Health:</h2>
          <p>
            Microplastics aren’t inert passengers in mammals: they enter circulation, lodge in tissues, and correlate with hard outcomes. Plastic particles were detected in 17/22 healthy adults’ blood at a mean ~1.6 µg/mL (≥700 nm; PET, PE, styrenics among the polymers), demonstrating systemic exposure in humans (Leslie et al., 2022). In a cardiovascular cohort of 304 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, those with micro/nanoplastics embedded in plaques had a 4.53× higher hazard of stroke, MI, or death over ~34 months (95% CI 2.00–10.27), linking tissue‐level plastic burden to clinical events (Marfella et al., 2024). Independent clinical work in acute coronary syndrome similarly associates higher blood microplastic loads with more complex vascular pathology and immuno-inflammatory shifts (e.g., IL-6, NK/B-cell changes) (Yang et al., 2024).Mechanistically, animal and cellular studies converge on oxidative stress, barrier dysfunction, and metabolic disruption as plausible pathways (Kadac-Czapska et al., 2024). Critically, dialing exposure down may not quickly reset biology: in mice exposed long-term (21 weeks) and then taken off microplastics for 4 weeks, lipid-metabolic and microbiome disturbances showed only partial recovery, especially after higher doses (Deng et al., 2025). Together, the evidence argues for upstream exposure reduction—and for practical strategies like immobilization at the source—to limit human contact and risk.
