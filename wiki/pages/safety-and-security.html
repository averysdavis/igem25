      <h4>Safety and Security Award</h4>
      <p>Synthetic biology will need to be used safely and securely if local people are to solve local problems all around the world. The Safety and Security Committee is challenging teams to apply biological engineering approaches to manage risks associated with synthetic biology. Can you take the next step in progress towards knowledge, understanding, and tools that will make the use of synthetic biology safer and more secure?</p>

    <h2>What Should this Page Contain?</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>Describe all potential safety and security risks associated with your project, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Biological risks (e.g., pathogenicity, toxicity, environmental impact).</li>
      <li>Chemical risks (e.g., handling hazardous materials).</li>
      <li>Physical risks (e.g., equipment safety).</li>
      <li>Security risks (e.g., potential misuse of technology).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Explain how you are addressing these risks and implementing safety measures.</p>
    <p>Detail any safety features incorporated into your project design, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choice of a non-pathogenic chassis.</li>
      <li>Selection of parts that minimize harm to humans, animals, or plants;</li>
      <li>Substitution of safer materials in experiments;</li>
      <li>Implementation of "kill-switch" mechanisms or other safety controls.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Explain the rationale behind these design choices.</p>
    <div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
      <p>Ensure that your project adheres to all safety requirements outlined in the <a href="https://responsibility.igem.org/safety-policies">Safety Policies page</a>.</p>

      <h1>Safety equipment</h1>
      <p>The lab that we work with, Biocurious, is equipped with several safety measures that aim to keep all occupants of the labs safe. All of the safety precautions that are used in Biocurious are in accordance with the federal biosafety levels. We have access to an eyewash station, masks, spill cleanup kits, fire extinguishers, and a biosafety cabinet. This ensures that if an accident is to occur, we are able to properly handle it.
      </p>
      <h1>PPE</h1>
      <p>At our lab we take measures to remain as safe as possible, as we are ultimately responsible for our own safety. All Biocurious occupants also are properly equipped with PPE including gloves, lab coats, and close-toed shoes to provide a basic level of protection from hazardous chemicals. 
      </p>
      <p>Further specific PPE including heat resistant gloves and face shields are available and used when contact with additional hazards are anticipated.
      </p>
      <h1>Storage and Disposal</h1>
      <p>All items stored in the lab are labeled with the name of the creator, the chemical, the date made, and any potential hazards the chemical may pose. For disposal we autoclave or bleach live bacteria before disposing of them. The lab also provides a disposal bin for glass and a biohazard waste disposal bin.      </p>
