          <h2>Our Team</h2>
          <p>
            Our team is the only active high school iGEM team in Northern California. We want iGEM and synthetic biology to be accessible to all high school students in the Bay Area, so we allow students from any school in the Bay Area to join. As a result, our team represents a variety of private and public schools including Helios, Gunn, La Entrada, Proof School, Bellarmine College Preparatory, and San Francisco University High School. Our team contains diverse perspectives, with <b>88% of members identifying as people of color and 53% of members identifying as female</b>.

          <h2>Community Engagement</h2>
          <p>
            We strive to reach diverse groups in our educational initiatives, expert outreach, and research. We led workshops in Mandarin and Spanish to facilitate synthetic biology learning in underrepresented communities. One of our initiatives was also run in Shreemaya Krishnadham Mandir, a Hindu temple in San Jose. This helped us reach the Hindu community in our area. In addition, our educational initiatives reached those of all ages, ranging from 6 years old to senior citizens. See education for more information.

          <h2>Lab Accessibility</h2>
          <p>
            Despite its name, Khan Lab School does not contain a lab. Due to this, our team is a proud member of Biocurious, a community lab in Santa Clara. This allows us to remain connected to other scientists and community efforts local to us.
