            <h1>Verification of Transformants</h1>
            <p>
              We performed chemical transformation of E. coli K-12 with our plasmid pET_csg-sazCA_amp, which is designed to express a curli fiber and carbonic anhydrase fusion protein under IPTG induction. Additionally, the plasmid has an ampicillin resistance gene, which enables selection of transformed colonies. We streaked our recovered transformants onto LB plates and LB/ampicillin plates and incubated them overnight at 37°C.

              For our bacteria without plasmid DNA, there was a smear on the LB plate and no bacteria on the LB/ampicillin plate. For our bacteria with plasmid DNA, there was a smear on the LB plate and individual colonies on the LB/ampicillin plate. This suggests that our ampicillin selection was successful and that our E. coli K-12 had likely been transformed.
            </p>
            <p>
              We performed colony PCR and colony sequencing, both of which confirmed that our transformation was successful.

            <h1>Production of Curli Fibers</h1>
            <p>
              Curli fibers are extracellular proteinaceous fibers with amyloid folds, comprising key components of biofilms in Enterobacteriaceae bacteria. In E. coli, there are seven curli-specific genes (csg) organized in two operons, csgBAC and csgDEFG. The structural subunits of curli are csgA and csgB, where csgB anchors to the outer membrane and csgA is the major curli fiber monomer. The protein csgC is a periplasmic chaperone, csgE, csgF, and csgG form the secretion assembly machinery, and csgD is a transcriptional activator of the csgBAC operon. Figure 2 from Bhoite et al., 2019, shows the curli secretion pathway.

              To test expression of our modified curli protein (<a href="https://registry.igem.org/parts/bba-259gv1ih">BBa_259GV1IH</a>), we used a congo red fluorescence assay inspired by Kan et al., 2019 and our conversations with the <a href="https://neel-joshi.sites.northeastern.edu/">Joshi Lab</a>. We ran the assay in quadruplicate on a 96-well plate to get better statistics.

                Graph of induced vs uninduced fluorescence readings of various cultures, with data in quadruplets. Samples 1,2 and 3 are transformant cultures. Sample 4 (joshi) is a strain we received from the Joshi Lab that expresses a different curli fusion protein and serves as a positive control. Sample 5 is untransformed E. coli K-12. Sample 6 (lb) has LB only (i.e., no E. coli) and serves as a negative control.

            </figure>
            <p>
              The increase in fluorescence between uninduced and induced cultures of our positive control indicated that our assay worked, but our transformants did not show a significant increase in fluorescence levels, indicating negligible curli fiber presence. To further investigate, we turned to computer modeling. Using AlphaFold 3, we modeled the oligomerization of our modified curli fiber and compared it against our positive control as well as to native E. coli K-12 curli. We saw significant differences in folding and assembly.

              In parallel, we sought to create a biomineralized product using S. pasteurii’s natural biomineralization capabilities. S pasteurii uses the urea hydrolysis pathway, which converts urea into ammonia and bicarbonate. When Ca2+ ions are added to the solution, calcium carbonate mineralizes around the bacteria. We confirmed biomineralization under a microscope.

            <p>
              To estimate the strength of our biomineralized material, we created molds following ASTM standards for tensile/compressive strength testing, but with scaled down dimensions. The resulting material had a cross-sectional area of 2 squared, allowing us to estimate tensile strength. However, the process of removing our biomineralized samples from the mold broke the material into several pieces, so we were unable to continue to the strength-testing stage.
