            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>As a team, we sought to share our knowledge of synthetic biology with others from our local community and beyond. We mostly accomplished this by teaching kids younger than ourselves in both school and non-school settings, but we also incorporated adult education as well in our September coffee chat. We did this because we want to demystify gene editing; many people view gene editing as something only top-level scientists can ever understand (and something so theoretical that it’s entirely divorced from day-to-day life), but the concepts underlying it are actually simpler and more universal than many would think. Once students understand the central tenets of synthetic biology, they are better equipped to understand the starring role it has in modern society and work in STEM fields.</p>

            <p>Our team visited Helios school, a K-8 independent school in Sunnyvale. We presented to a group of thirty 8th-grade students in the morning to introduce synthetic biology and have a hands-on activity.</p>
            <p>We started the day by introducing our team, what iGEM is, and what we do. We then gave a short presentation on our 2024 iGEM project, Eat Methane! During our presentation, we made sure our audience was engaged by asking questions and having students answer. We then asked students what they knew about synthetic biology and DNA</p>
            <!--Carousel-->

            <p>We gave an introduction to the Central Dogma, DNA, protein production, and gene expression. After explaining some background information, students then engaged in our “strawberry DNA” activity. Students extracted DNA from strawberries, showing them that science was not exclusively found in labs, but could be accessed anywhere. Students also learned that genomics surrounds us, everyone and every living thing, including their strawberries, are a part of biology and genetic science. The hands-on strawberry DNA activity assisted students in visualizing the structures that we described in ourpresentation, and was a great way for them to get exposure to synthetic biology as a whole. </p>
            <p>We then ended the day with cleanup, followed by a discussion and presentation about the activity. We explained how the different components added to the strawberries, dish soap, salt, and alcohol, all help extract the DNA from cells. Lastly, we asked the students to fill out a small survey describing their experience during the education visit.</p>
            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p>After analyzing our survey, we found that most students enjoyed the activity and found it interesting, although not exceptionally so. It also seemed as if we did not tailor our presentation well enough to our audience as many students reported that the activity was too easy. As for their interest in synthetic biology after the presentation, most students reported a 3, a moderate level of interest. We incorporated this feedback into our later education sessions. </p>
