          <div class="col-10">
            <p>As a team, we sought to share our knowledge of synthetic biology with others from our local community and beyond. We  accomplished this by teaching kids younger than ourselves in both school and non-school settings. 
              We did this because we want to demystify synthetic biology, as many people view synthetic biology as something only top-level scientists can ever understand, so theoretical that it’s entirely divorced from day-to-day life. By revealing the underlying concepts, students can realize synthetic biology is more accesible than many would think. 
              Once students understand the central tenets of synthetic biology, they are better equipped to understand the starring role it has in modern society and work in STEM fields.</p>

            <h1>Synthetic Biology Class</h1>
            <p>To familiarize the team with the molecular biology techniques used within synthetic biology, a 10 week long course with lectures and labs was developed and run by our team captain, Ansh. 
              The course assumed knowledge of basic biochemistry concepts taught by our team in a similar course last year. 
              The new techniques taught this year allowed students to run labs such as transforming plasmids from the iGEM distribution kit into E.coli. 
              At the end of the course, students worked together to design, execute, and document an experiment to assay the efficency of a custom made centrifuge and thermocycler.</p>

            <p>Our team visited Helios school, a K-8 independent school in Sunnyvale. 
              We presented to a group of thirty 8th-grade students in the morning to introduce synthetic biology and conducted a hands-on activity.</p>
            <p>We started the day by introducing our team, what iGEM is, and what we do. 
              We then gave a short presentation on our 2024 iGEM project, Eat Methane! 
              We then asked students what they knew about synthetic biology and DNA. 
              Throughout our presentation, we asked questions and had the students answer to ensure they understood the concepts and stayed engaged.</p>

            <p>We gave an introduction to the Central Dogma, DNA, protein production, and gene expression. 
              After explaining some background information, students then particpated in our “strawberry DNA” activity. 
              Students extracted DNA from strawberries, showing them that science was not exclusively found in labs, but could be accessed anywhere. 
              Students also learned that genomics surrounds us. Everyone and every living thing, including their strawberries, are a part of biology and genetic science. 
              The hands-on strawberry DNA activity assisted students in visualizing the structures that we described in our presentation, and was a great way for them to get exposure to synthetic biology as a whole.</p>
            <p>We then ended the day with cleanup, followed by a discussion and presentation about the activity. 
              We explained how the different components added to the strawberries, dish soap, salt, and alcohol, all help extract the DNA from cells. 
              Lastly, we asked the students to fill out a small survey describing their experience during the education visit.</p>

            <p>After analyzing our survey, we found that most students enjoyed the activity and found it interesting, although not exceptionally so. 
              It also seemed as if we did not tailor our presentation well enough to our audience as many students reported that the activity felt easy. 
              As for their interest in synthetic biology after the presentation, most students reported a 3, a moderate level of interest. 
              We incorporated this feedback into our later education sessions.</p>

            <p>Members from our team visited Laurel Elementary School, a public school in Menlo Park with Spanish immersion education. 
              We presented to two groups of around twenty 5th graders, in Spanish and in English, to explain DNA base pairs with a hands-on activity. </p>
            <p>We began the day by introducing iGEM and how DNA works by explaining what animals and cells have in common as well as the shape of DNA. 
              Students were engaged, and asked questions such as “How does DNA make people?” </p>

            <p>We did a quick survey to see what the kids knew about biology/genetics and as we would expect, the knowledge was minimal. 
              We then gave some information on DNA base pairs and the sugar-phosphate backbone and how it makes the iconic double-helix shape. 
              Then, we explained the activity and students proceeded to engage in the “Froot Loops DNA Base Pairs” activity. </p>

            <p>Students used different colors of Froot Loops to then represent DNA base pairs. 
              Red representing A, orange representing T, purple representing C, and green representing D. 
              This activity provided a similar hands on synthetic biology experience to the strawberry DNA activity from Helios, 
              but on a lower leve to match the age range of the younger students. </p>
            <p>The students synthesized imaginary creatures by assigning specific attributes, represented by base pairs, to construct a unique organism. </p>
            <p>We ended the activity with a reflection and asked students what they learned, and if they’d do the activity again. 
              We got mixed results, giving us insights into what the students enjoyed and didn’t enjoy about the activity. 
              We then repeated this for the second group of children.</p>

            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>We incorporated the feedback from our last visit into the planning for this one. Since the students at Laurel were younger than those in Helios, we developed a less intensive and more playful set of activities. However, it seemed that our efforts to make synthetic biology seem entertaining fell short, as we noticed that students where uninterested in the actual activity and were focused on eating the Froot Loops and the animals they designed. We learned that for this younger audience, we needed to make the activities more entertaining.</p>

            <p>Our team visited the Shreemaya Krishnadham Mandir, a Hindu temple in San Jose, California. 
              The purpose of the visit was to introduce and discuss synthetic biology concepts to the temple students. 
              This visit was split into two parts. The morning from 9-12 was with three students ages 9-12, 
              while in the evening, the three students were joined by five other students, ages between 6-18.</p>
            <p>We started the day by introducing biology and what iGEM is. 
              We then moved on to a presentation about macromolecules and taught the students our 2025 iGEM project. 
              To compliment the macromolecules presentation, we ran a cheese-making lab while explaining the background biology that made the processes work.</p>

            <p>We were then joined by the second group of students. 
              To get the students excited about DNA, we ran the strawberry DNA activity while explaining the structure of DNA. 
              We continued our exploration of DNA by explaining the central dogma, 
              the process by which DNA is converted into a protein. </p>
            <p>To ensure the students' understanding of the Central Dogma, we then ran a Central Dogma relay race, 
              where each student acted as a member of the central dogma process (e.g. acting as a ribosome or as rna polymerase). 
              A member started by creating a DNA strand of an animal out of froot loops on a string based on traits from a modified amino acid table. 
              The next person converted the DNA froot loop strand into an RNA froot loop strand. 
              The third person performed the job of the ribosome, converting the strand back into traits from a modified amino acid table. 
              They then drew the animal based on the traits!</p>

            <p> Finally, we ended the day with a carbon footprint detective activity, where students learned to calculate their total carbon footprint.

            <p>Twenty-two students from China, 8 to 14 years old, visited Khan Lab School as part of a summer camp. 
              The students came from various parts of China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and more. 
              Two members of our team, entirely in Mandarin, ran a presentation on DNA and a DNA extraction activity. </p>

            <p>We started by first introducing our team and our members, then asking each student to introduce themselves. 
              The team explained what iGEM is and introduced the concept of synthetic biology. 
              We then talked about DNA and its place in biology. 
              Throughout the presentation, we asked the students questions to keep them engaged and see how much they already knew.</p>

            <p>We then ran the strawberry DNA activity, using the protocol one of our members translated, showing them DNA is very common in the world and giving them hands-on experience. 
              The visit concluded with a Q&A about science, Khan Lab School, and student life in the United States. 
              Students were free to ask any questions they had about the differences between life in the U.S. and China, how much homework we recieved, how school schedules worked, how we engage with science, etc.</p>

          <p>Attendees: Alisha, Anandita, Ansh, Avery, Khushi, Paul, Sameer, Uday, Zoya, Baxter</p>
          
          <p>CRISPR Kit is an initiative by Stanford University’s Stanley Qi Lab working to make biotechnology more accessible to high school students. Prior to the beginning of the school year, our team began working with the Stanley Qi Lab to adapt CRISPR Kit for Khan Lab School. In Khan Lab School, 10th and 11th grade students are encouraged to pursue a Cornerstone project. Cornerstone projects are year-long projects where students explore any topic they’re interested in, with the goal of improving their community. With this in mind, we began integrating CRISPR Kit with Cornerstone.</p>
          <embed type="application/pdf" src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5761/humanpractices/education/crisprkit/crisprcornerstone.pdf" width="100%" height="800px">
          <p>Cornerstone was adapted to have, over the course of three weeks in September, have three sessions exploring the biodesign process, CRISPR, and experiment design. Sessions were lead by members of the Qi Lab including Abigail Alemayeho, a Stanford student pursuing her bachelor degree in bioengineering and data science, Andre Gu, a bioengineering PhD student, and Dr. Alex Choi, a postdoctoral scholar studying microscopy and CRISPR. Members of our team assisted the Qi lab members throughout the process and worked as Teacher assistant during sessions.</p>

          <p>The first session was a general introduction to the Stanford biodesign process, beginning with the Identify phase. 
            Students learned how to find unmet needs, conduct research and interviews to gain expertise, and formulate a clear "Needs" Statement. 
            The presentation emphasized that solving a problem required understanding the problem thoroughly before jumping to solutions.</p>
          <p>Students were then sorted into groups of two and given a handout with a cookie-making analogy to practice their problem solving skills. 
            Once finished, several students presented their solutions to recieve constructive feedback. 
            The day introduced the importance of teamwork, decision-making, accessibility, and set the foundation for the Invent phase in the next sessions.</p>

          <p>With this, students began the melanin production pathway experiment, allowing students to see a practical, visual application of CRISPR via a color change reaction. This reinforced the concept of a cell-free system that drastically reduces cost.</p>
