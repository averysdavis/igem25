<!--Overview-->
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>In developing our project, we sought to use research and expert outreach to tailor our project to the potential communities it would serve. We talked to stakeholders at each phase of the project, gaining valuable feedback on our ideas and prototypes. This process allowed us to discover the most practical path forward for our project and make sure we were using our time well.</p>

    <h1>Project Ideation</h1>
    <p>
      To supplement our preliminary research, we contacted academics in [areas] we were interested in exploring. Our meeting with Dr. Phillip Kyriakaki and Dr. Sukri Silas, as well as a team poll and consultation with Dr. Chris Hernandez, our secondary PI, allowed us to finalize our project idea.

    <div> <!--Add class-->
      <h2>Dr. Phillip Kyriakakis</h2>
      <p>February 14, 2025</p>
      <p>Attendees: Ansh, Khushi, Avery, Paul, Nick, Anandita, Sameer, Zoya, Alisha</p>
      <p>Phillip Kyriakakis, Ph.D. is a Senior Research Scientist in the Bioengineering Department at Stanford University and a member of the Wu Tsai Institute for Neuroscience.</p>
      <h3>What We Learned</h3>
      <p>Our team visited Dr. Kyriakakis’ lab at Stanford. He gave a presentation on his research in optogenetics, explaining how it enables scientists to use light to control neurons and other cells. After the presentation, we split into two groups to tour different areas of his lab, where we also had the chance to briefly meet a member of the Stanford iGEM team. Dr. Kyriakakis highlighted opportunities for collaboration and pointed us toward local resources and mentors who could support our work.</p>
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Seek local resources and mentorship</b>: Connect with nearby universities, labs, and experts for advice and potential collaboration.</li>
        <li><b>Learn from peers</b>: Engaging with teams like Stanford iGEM can provide new perspectives and build community connections.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Implementation</h3>
      <p>We looked for stakeholders in our local community</p>

      <h2>Dr. Sukrit Silas</h2>
      <p>April 18, 2025</p>
      <p>Attendees: Ansh, Zoya, Avery, Khushi, Anandita, Nikhil, Sameer, Meghna, Alyssa, Alisha, Paul, Sara</p>
      <p>Dr. Sukrit Silas is a Principal Investigator at the Gladstone Institutes and an expert in phage-bacteria dynamics and bacterial immune systems. His group is particularly interested in phage accessory genes—small proteins that allow phages to evade bacterial defenses.</p>
      <h3>What We Learned</h3>
      <p>Our team visited Dr. Silas’ lab at the Gladstone Institutes while exploring a possible phage-based iGEM project. He explained the challenges of phage therapy, particularly how phages tend to be effective only against very specific bacterial strains, and how defenses like receptor shielding can block infection even when receptors appear to match.
        He also introduced his lab’s ongoing work testing accessory genes by expressing them in E. coli to map their role in infection. 
        His postdoc discussed how AI and computational tools can predict host range, model resistance, and guide cocktail design. Importantly, Dr. Silas suggested a potential iGEM direction: testing phage cocktails—combinations of different phages—to broaden effectiveness against E. coli.
        Ultimately, this idea was not feasible for us since community labs such as BioCurious prohibit phage use, and we lacked access to phage-dedicated containment facilities.</p>
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Phage-host interactions</b> are highly strain-specific, unlike antibiotics.</li>
        <li><b>Receptor shielding</b> is a key bacterial defense blocking many infections.</li>
        <li>Dr. Silas’ lab is creating a <b>functional map of accessory genes</b> to understand how phages evade defenses.</li>
        <li><b>AI modeling</b> can help predict phage-host interactions and optimize cocktails.</li>
        <li>A strong project idea was to test <b>phage cocktails</b>, but this was not possible due to biosafety limits.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Implementation</h3>
      <p>Our team researched if we could conduct the project Dr. Silas suggested. We looked into how to safely work with phages and discussed how we could use AI in our project.</p>

    <!--Community Integration and Lab Space-->
    <div> <!--Add class-->
      <h2>Community Integration and Lab Space</h2>
      <p>From the beginning, our team knew we wanted to integrate community projects and efforts into our project. Due to this, we decided to conduct wetlab work at BioCurious, a community biotech lab. Unfortunately, BioCurious has a policy against working with phages in order to protect other member’s work.</p>
      <h3>Implementation</h3>
      <p>We decided to not attempt a phage project in order to remain integrated with our community.</p>
    </div>
    <!--Team poll-->
    <div><!--Add class-->
      <h2>Team Poll</h2>
      <p>April 2025</p>
      <p>Simultaneously as discussing community labs, we polled our members on which project they would like to pursue. At this point we had narrowed down to three ideas: Phage therapy (ruled out), living houses, and grass water loss. Living Houses won with 58.8% of the vote, making it our official project.</p>
