          <p>In developing our project, we sought to use research and expert outreach to tailor our project to the potential communities it would serve. We talked to stakeholders at each phase of the project, gaining valuable feedback on our ideas and prototypes. This process allowed us to discover the most practical path forward for our project and make sure we were using our time well.</p>

            <h3>What We Learned</h3>
            <p>Our team visited Dr. Kyriakakis’ lab at Stanford. He gave a presentation on his research in optogenetics, explaining how it enables scientists to use light to control neurons and other cells. After the presentation, we split into two groups to tour different areas of his lab, where we also had the chance to briefly meet a member of the Stanford iGEM team. Dr. Kyriakakis highlighted opportunities for collaboration and pointed us toward local resources and mentors who could support our work.</p>
          
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Seek local resources and mentorship</b>: Connect with nearby universities, labs, and experts for advice and potential collaboration.</li>
              <li><b>Learn from peers</b>: Engaging with teams like Stanford iGEM can provide new perspectives and build community connections.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>We looked for stakeholders in our local community</p>

          <div id="sukritsilas" class="mb-5">
            <h2>Dr. Sukrit Silas</h2><p>April 18, 2025</p>
            <p>Attendees: Ansh, Zoya, Avery, Khushi, Anandita, Nikhil, Sameer, Meghna, Alyssa, Alisha, Paul, Sara</p>
            <p>Dr. Sukrit Silas is a Principal Investigator at the Gladstone Institutes and an expert in phage-bacteria dynamics and bacterial immune systems. His group is particularly interested in phage accessory genes—small proteins that allow phages to evade bacterial defenses.</p>
            <h3>What We Learned</h3>
            <p>Our team visited Dr. Silas’ lab at the Gladstone Institutes while exploring a possible phage-based iGEM project. He explained the challenges of phage therapy, particularly how phages tend to be effective only against very specific bacterial strains, and how defenses like receptor shielding can block infection even when receptors appear to match.
              He also introduced his lab’s ongoing work testing accessory genes by expressing them in E. coli to map their role in infection. 
              His postdoc discussed how AI and computational tools can predict host range, model resistance, and guide cocktail design. Importantly, Dr. Silas suggested a potential iGEM direction: testing phage cocktails—combinations of different phages—to broaden effectiveness against E. coli.
              Ultimately, this idea was not feasible for us since community labs such as BioCurious prohibit phage use, and we lacked access to phage-dedicated containment facilities.</p>
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Phage-host interactions</b> are highly strain-specific, unlike antibiotics.</li>
              <li><b>Receptor shielding</b> is a key bacterial defense blocking many infections.</li>
              <li>Dr. Silas’ lab is creating a <b>functional map of accessory genes</b> to understand how phages evade defenses.</li>
              <li><b>AI modeling</b> can help predict phage-host interactions and optimize cocktails.</li>
              <li>A strong project idea was to test <b>phage cocktails</b>, but this was not possible due to biosafety limits.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>Our team researched if we could conduct the project Dr. Silas suggested. We looked into how to safely work with phages and discussed how we could use AI in our project.</p>

          <div id="community" class="mb-5">
            <h2>Community Integration and Lab Space</h2>
            <p>From the beginning, our team knew we wanted to integrate community projects and efforts into our project. Due to this, we decided to conduct wetlab work at BioCurious, a community biotech lab. Unfortunately, BioCurious has a policy against working with phages in order to protect other member’s work.</p>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>We decided to not attempt a phage project in order to remain integrated with our community.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="poll" class="mb-5">
            <h2>Team Poll</h2>
            <p>April 2025</p>
            <p>Simultaneously as discussing community labs, we polled our members on which project they would like to pursue. At this point we had narrowed down to three ideas: Phage therapy (ruled out), living houses, and grass water loss. Living Houses won with 58.8% of the vote, making it our official project.</p>

            <p>May 2025</p>
            <p>With our project decided, we met with our secondary investigator, Chris Hernandez, who is a professor at University of California, San Francisco. At this point the project idea was only defined as designing a “living” material that would grow or build itself (hence “living houses"). We discussed biomineralization, which is Chris’s specialty, and how to ensure our project helps the community. We discussed a variety of problems, including plastics and microplastics returning to the environment after capture. With Chris’s advice, we pivoted our project to address local problems.</p>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>Our project “living houses” was redefined as “rock the plastics,” where we trap plastics with biomineralization.</p>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>Because dredging and backfilling is a major issue in  the San Francisco Bay Area, we decided we wanted to address it to protect our community. We decided to use our material to replace non renewable materials used in backfilling. This became the primary application of the material we designed.

He works with multiple nonprofit organizations in order to put innovative microplastics mitigation strategies into practice. </p>
            <h3>Key Feedback</h3>
            <p>Dr. Cowger advised that we should focus on capturing only fluorescent spheres for two reasons: because it would be easier to verify results on a fluorescent material and it’s less complicated to test our protocol on only one carefully controlled type of microplastic than on an assortment of plastics of various different compositions. He also said that it would be difficult to ensure that our biomineralization process captures only plastics. </p>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>We decided to implement our project on filtered water only to remove the issue of non-plastic capture. In addition, we’ll be testing on only one form of common microplastic because of Win’s advice.

            <h3>Advice</h3>
            <p>Through an email, we got insight on curli quantification methods and got feedback on our synthetically designed plasmid pET-csg-sazCA-amp. We later met Shanna online, where we asked about potentially creating a fusion protein with urease and csgA. Shanna informed us that her team had experience fusing smaller proteins to csgA, and that larger, multi-subunit proteins like urease might present a challenge. Shanna was also a great help in sending us E. coli with the plasmid that would express a fusion protein of csgA and a GFP antibody.

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>Due to Shanna’s advice, we decided to use a Congo Red assay instead of a Thioflavin T assay for quantification of curli fibers. It was also due to Shanna’s recommendations that we ran a pull down as well as fluorescence based assay for Curli fibers.

            </p>
            <h3>Advice</h3>
            <p>We met Shohreh when visiting Joshi lab in person at Northeastern University. She prepared and provided us with a E.coli Mach1 strain transformed with pBbB8k-csg-NbGFP, a plasmid which the Joshi lab had confirmed expresses Curli fibers and showed us around the lab. She also brought to our attention the concern of protein aggregate formation when using Congo red assays. While in the lab, Shohreh described how they may use PDMS microfluidic devices, noting that they had to use specialized molds since 3d prints did not have high enough resolution. However, when we mentioned how large our mold was, Shohreh mentioned that should be okay.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Feedback</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Congo red can form aggregates with curli fibers leading to inconsistent spec readings.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>We were able to utilize the strain Shoreh provided us to act as a positive control in our biofilm formation assays. Further, to counteract the issue of aggregate formation, we utilized a strategy Shoreh mentioned was used in Joshi lab—taking a grid of measurements in a plate reader.</p>
