<!--Overview-->
<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>In developing our project, we sought to use research and expert outreach to tailor our project to the potential communities it would serve. We talked to stakeholders at each phase of the project, gaining valuable feedback on our ideas and prototypes. This process allowed us to discover the most practical path forward for our project and make sure we were using our time well.</p>

    <!--Phillip Kyriakakis-->
    <div> <!--Add class-->
      <h2>Dr. Phillip Kyriakakis</h2>
      <p>Phillip Kyriakakis, Ph.D. is a Senior Research Scientist in the Bioengineering Department at Stanford University and a member of the Wu Tsai Institute for Neuroscience.</p>
      <h3>What We Learned</h3>
      <p>Our team visited Dr. Kyriakakis’ lab at Stanford. He gave a presentation on his research in optogenetics, explaining how it enables scientists to use light to control neurons and other cells. After the presentation, we split into two groups to tour different areas of his lab, where we also had the chance to briefly meet a member of the Stanford iGEM team. Dr. Kyriakakis highlighted opportunities for collaboration and pointed us toward local resources and mentors who could support our work.</p>
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Seek local resources and mentorship</b>: Connect with nearby universities, labs, and experts for advice and potential collaboration.</li>
        <li><b>Learn from peers</b>: Engaging with teams like Stanford iGEM can provide new perspectives and build community connections.</li>
      </ul>

    <!--Sukrit Silas-->
    <div> <!--Add class-->
      <h2>Dr. Sukrit Silas</h2>
      <p>Dr. Sukrit Silas is a Principal Investigator at the Gladstone Institutes and an expert in phage-bacteria dynamics and bacterial immune systems. His group is particularly interested in phage accessory genes—small proteins that allow phages to evade bacterial defenses.</p>
      <h3>What We Learned</h3>
      <p>Our team visited Dr. Silas’ lab at the Gladstone Institutes while exploring a possible phage-based iGEM project. He explained the challenges of phage therapy, particularly how phages tend to be effective only against very specific bacterial strains, and how defenses like receptor shielding can block infection even when receptors appear to match.
        He also introduced his lab’s ongoing work testing accessory genes by expressing them in E. coli to map their role in infection. 
        His postdoc discussed how AI and computational tools can predict host range, model resistance, and guide cocktail design. Importantly, Dr. Silas suggested a potential iGEM direction: testing phage cocktails—combinations of different phages—to broaden effectiveness against E. coli.
        Ultimately, this idea was not feasible for us since community labs such as BioCurious prohibit phage use, and we lacked access to phage-dedicated containment facilities.</p>
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Phage-host interactions</b> are highly strain-specific, unlike antibiotics.</li>
        <li><b>Receptor shielding</b> is a key bacterial defense blocking many infections.</li>
        <li>Dr. Silas’ lab is creating a <b>functional map of accessory genes</b> to understand how phages evade defenses.</li>
        <li><b>AI modeling</b> can help predict phage-host interactions and optimize cocktails.</li>
        <li>A strong project idea was to test <b>phage cocktails</b>, but this was not possible due to biosafety limits.</li>
