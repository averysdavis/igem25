          <h1>Initial Considerations</h1>
            <p>
              Our goal was to design bacteria that would simultaneously produce a sticky biofilm and induce biomineralization, capturing microplastics and forming an aggregate usable in construction. We chose to use curli fibers, a key component of E. coli biofilms, because they exhibit high adhesive properties and strong tensile mechanical properties (Zhang et al., 2017). Examining pathways involved in Microbially Induced Calcite Precipitation (MICP), we found that bacterial strains utilizing the urea hydrolysis pathway showed more calcite precipitation (~20–80%) in comparison with other metabolic pathways (Castro-Alonso et al., 2019). This pathway is primarily driven by the enzymes urease and carbonic anhydrase. To simultaneously produce curli fibers and induce biomineralization, we decided to emulate the fusion protein of curli fiber and amylase that Neel Joshi’s Biologically Fabricated Materials Lab designed (Birnbaum et al., 2021). Since carbonic anhydrase is a monomeric enzyme in the urea hydrolysis pathway, it was natural to design and experiment with a curli fiber and carbonic anhydrase fusion protein. We chose to use the strain E. coli K12 to express our fusion protein, as E. coli K12 can, under the right conditions, produce both curli fiber and carbonic anhydrase. 
            </p>
            <p>Our second goal was to create concrete biomineralized products. We chose to use S. pasteurii, as it naturally used the urea hydrolysis pathway, which eventually converts urea into ammonia and carbonate </p>

          <h1>DBTL Cycles: Curli + MICP</h1>
          <h3>Overview of part: curli + sazCA</h3>
          <p>
            The goal of this part was to simultaneously produce curli fiber and induce biomineralization using one fusion protein. The <a href = "https://2023.igem.wiki/msp-maastricht/engineering.html">2023 iGEM team MSP-Maastricht’s</a> biomineralization carbonic anhydrase module inspired us to use sazCA, which is also the fastest carbonic anhydrase to date (Y. Zhu et al., 2021). As such, our final part’s primary goal was to produce a csgA-sazCA fusion protein.

          <h1>DBTL Cycle 1</h1>
          <h2>Design:</h2>
          <p>
            To simultaneously produce curli fiber and induce biomineralization, we designed a part [part link here] that could express a fusion protein of csgA, the primary curli monomer, and sazCA, the fastest carbonic anhydrase to date. We inserted our part—derived from the Neel Joshi Lab, 2023 iGEM team MSP-Maastricht and Zhu, Yinzhuang et al., 2021—into the Twist vector pET_blank (Amp), making our final plasmid [insert part here]. Hence, our transformed bacteria with this plasmid would have ampicillin resistance and would express our curli-sazCA fusion when iPTG is present.
          </p>
          <h2>Build:</h2>
          <p>
            Once our plasmid was synthesized by Twist, we performed chemical transformation on two tubes of wild E. coli K12, one of which we added our plasmid pET-csg-sazCA-amp. We recovered and plated the transformed cultures on both LB plates and LB/amp plates, letting the plates incubate overnight at 37C.

          <p>As hypothesized, for our bacteria without plasmid DNA, there was a smear on the LB plate and no bacteria on the LB/amp plate. For our bacteria with plasmid DNA, there was a smear on the LB plate and individual colonies on the LB/amp plate. This confirmed that our ampicillin was working properly, and that our E. coli K12 had likely been transformed. </p>
          <p>
            We further confirmed the transformation of our E. coli by performing colony PCR and sequencing via Plasmidsaurus. </p>

          <h2>Test:</h2>
          <p>
            Our first step was to test a variety of inducer concentration to find what optimized expression. To test expression  we utilized a congo red fluorescence assay inspired by (Kan et al., 2019) as well as a spin down curli assay from as well as a spin down congo red assay from iGEM team Delft-Leiden.

          </figure>
          <p>From these results, we decided to proceed with an inducer concentration of 0.2 mM.
          </p>
          <p>With our transformants, we then performed a congo red fluorescence assay to test for the presence of curli fibers. Congo red binds to amyloid fibrils like those found in curli fibers, producing more fluorescence at 525nm excitation and 625nm emission when bound to these fibrils. We induced each of our cultures with 0.2 mM iPTG and ran a congo red fluorescence assay.

            This assay supported our positive control expressing curli, but indicated to us that our transformants were struggling to express curli. Given that our transformants were confirmed by sequencing, we suspected that our protein had issues folding.

          <p>Having a suggestion from the Dry Lab, we designed a Wet Lab based experiment to confirm if issues were happening at the protein folding stage or later. </p>
          <p>To do this we designed individual IPTG inducible constructs with our proteins, Curli and Carbonic anhydrase. Our goal was to confirm that expression of each individual protein was successful, which would support the conclusion that the problem was unique to the modified protein. </p>

            We additionally planned a RT-PCR assay. RT-PCR would allow us to view the amount of mRNA produced from a given construct, via first converting it to cDNA and then amplifying it. This would potentially confirm that transcription was present in our modified construct, and support that the issue lied at the translation/protein folding stage. 
            </p>
            <p>In designing RT-PCR assay, we included a positive control of the RSS housekeeping gene in E.coli to confirm the validity of our assay.</p>
            <h2>Build:</h2>
            <p>We utilized our previously made competent cells to create transformants of both constructs. 
              We ordered reagents required to run a RT-PCR assay, including custom primers and Reverse Transcriptase. 
              </p>
            <h2>Test:</h2>
            <p>We ran a congo red fluorescence assay on both our Curli only construct, confirming curli individually did express successfully in E.coli K-12 and that the problem resided in the fusion protein.</p>

            <p>We additionally confirmed that expression of Curli fibers functioned within E.coli K-12 when not modified, through the creation and characterization of a construct involving solely Curli fibers. We used the fluorescence assay described earlier to demonstrate presence of protein expression.</p>
            <p>Finally, we also tested expression of Carbonic anhydrase through the Wilbur Anderson assay <a href = "https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4665005">2023 iGEM team MSP-Maastricht</a>. Unfortunately, we ran into issues with continuously reducing measurements from when our CO2 solution was opened, a known issue with the assay. In the limited time we had remaining, we were unable to further optimize the assay to see usable results. </p>
            <h2>Learn:</h2>
            <p>Through both expression of unmodified proteins and RT-PCR data, we were able to support our hypothesis that the issue with our modified construct occurs at the protein folding/oligomerization stage.</p>
            <h2>Overview of Part: Curli + Urease</h2>
            <p>As soon as we discovered that there may be potential folding issues with our curli fiber and carbonic anhydrase fusion protein, we switched tracks to design a part with urease instead of carbonic anhydrase. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were unable to make it past the design and build stage. </p>
