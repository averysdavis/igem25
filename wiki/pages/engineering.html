              Our goal was to design bacteria that would simultaneously produce curli fiber and induce biomineralization. Neel Joshi’s Biologically Fabricated Materials Lab has designed and successfully expressed a fusion protein between csgA, the primary curli fiber monomer, and the enzyme amylase. As such, we wished 
              There are a multitude of biomineralization pathways, but the most efficient monomeric enzyme catalyzing this pathway was carbonic anhydrase. We chose to use E. coli to hijack their natural functions, as E. coli naturally produces biofilm under cold conditions and naturally produces carbonic anhydrase.

            To simultaneously produce curli fiber and induce biomineralization, we designed a part that will express a fusion protein of csgA and carbonic anhydrase.

            <li>Insert our part to Twist vector pET_blank (Amp) at site (x)</li>
            <li>Chose this vector because it has lac operon with iPTG</li>
            <li>Our part is derived from Neel Joshi Lab and xyz iGEM team</li>
