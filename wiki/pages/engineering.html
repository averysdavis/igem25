          <h1>Initial Considerations</h1>
            <p>
              Our goal was to design bacteria that would simultaneously produce a sticky biofilm and induce biomineralization, capturing microplastics and forming an aggregate usable in construction. We chose to use curli fibers, a key component of E. coli biofilms, because they exhibit high adhesive properties and strong tensile mechanical properties (Zhang et al., 2017). Examining pathways involved in Microbially Induced Calcite Precipitation (MICP), we found that bacterial strains utilizing the urea hydrolysis pathway showed more calcite precipitation (~20–80%) in comparison with other metabolic pathways (Castro-Alonso et al., 2019). This pathway is primarily driven by the enzymes urease and carbonic anhydrase. To simultaneously produce curli fibers and induce biomineralization, we decided to emulate the fusion protein of curli fiber and amylase that Neel Joshi’s Biologically Fabricated Materials Lab designed (Birnbaum et al., 2021). Since carbonic anhydrase is a monomeric enzyme in the urea hydrolysis pathway, it was natural to design and experiment with a curli fiber and carbonic anhydrase fusion protein. We chose to use the strain E. coli K12 to express our fusion protein, as E. coli K12 can, under the right conditions, produce both curli fiber and carbonic anhydrase. 
            </p>
            <p>Our second goal was to create concrete biomineralized products. We chose to use S. pasteurii, which naturally has a urea hydrolysis pathway that induces calcium carbonate precipitation. We used sand to act as a substrate and scaffold for mineralization.</p>

The <a href = "https://2023.igem.wiki/msp-maastricht/engineering.html">2023 iGEM team MSP-Maastricht’s</a> biomineralization carbonic anhydrase module inspired us to use sazCA, which is also the fastest carbonic anhydrase to date (Y.

          <p class="pt-2">
            To simultaneously produce curli fiber and induce biomineralization, we designed a part <a href="https://registry.igem.org/parts/bba-25a8q07g">BBa_25A8Q07G</a> that could produce and export a fusion protein of csgA, the primary curli monomer, and sazCA, the fastest carbonic anhydrase to date. Our designed curli fusion protein emulates the curli fusion proteins from Neel Joshi’s Lab (Birnhaum et al., 2021), connecting csgA to sazCA via a flexible linker. We inserted our composite part <a href="https://registry.igem.org/parts/bba-25a8q07g">BBa_25A8Q07G</a> into the Twist vector pET blank (Amp), creating the plasmid <a href="https://registry.igem.org/parts/bba-25j7amcd">BBa_25J7AMCD</a>. Thus, our transformants would express ampicillin resistance and would express our curli-sazCA fusion protein in the presence of IPTG.
          </p>
          <h2>Build:</h2>
          <p>
            Once our plasmid was synthesized by Twist, we performed chemical transformation on two tubes of wild E. coli K12, one of which we added our plasmid pET-csg-sazCA-amp. We recovered and plated the transformed cultures on both LB plates and LB/amp plates, letting the plates incubate overnight at 37C.

          <p>As hypothesized, for our bacteria without plasmid DNA, there was a smear on the LB plate and no bacteria on the LB/amp plate. For our bacteria with plasmid DNA, there was a smear on the LB plate and individual colonies on the LB/amp plate. This confirmed that our ampicillin was working properly, and that our E. coli K12 had likely been transformed. </p>

            We further confirmed the transformation of our E. coli by performing colony PCR and sequencing via Plasmidsaurus. </p>

          <p>
            Our first step was to test a range of IPTG concentrations to find the optimal concentration for inducing protein expression. To test protein expression, we used a congo red fluorescence assay inspired by Kan et al. (2019) as well as an absorbance-based spin-down assay from the iGEM Delft-Leiden team.

          <p>From these results, we decided to proceed with an inducer concentration of 0.2 mM.
          </p>
          <p>With our transformants, we then performed a congo red fluorescence assay to test for the presence of curli fibers. Congo red binds to amyloid fibrils like those found in curli fibers, producing more fluorescence at 525nm excitation and 625nm emission when bound to these fibrils. We induced each of our cultures with 0.2 mM iPTG and ran a congo red fluorescence assay.

            We additionally planned a reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay. RT-PCR would allow us to view the amount of mRNA produced from a given construct, via first converting it to cDNA and then amplifying it. This would potentially confirm that transcription was present in our modified construct, and support that the issue lied at the translation/protein folding stage. 
            </p>
            <p>In designing RT-PCR assay, we included a positive control of the RSS housekeeping gene in E.coli to confirm the validity of our assay.</p>

            <p>To further quantify RNA expression of our genes relative to the rssA housekeeping gene, we ran RT-qPCR utilizing Bioneer’s accupower greenstar qPCR mix. ΔΔCq values were plotted, and the results showed highly similar induction across csg-sazCA gene cluster (BBa_25A8Q07G) and the unmodified curli operon (BBa_25A80I7T). This further supports that lack of expression resulted from issues that were post transcriptional.</p>
            <p>Finally, we also tested expression of carbonic anhydrase through the Wilbur Anderson assay <a href = "https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4665005">2023 iGEM team MSP-Maastricht</a>. Unfortunately, we ran into issues with continuously reducing measurements from when our CO2 solution was opened, a known issue with the assay. In the limited time we had remaining, we were unable to further optimize the assay to see usable results. </p>

            <p>Through both expression of unmodified proteins and RT-PCR data, we were able to support our hypothesis that the issue with our modified construct occurs at the protein folding/oligomerization stage.</p>

          <h1>DTBL Cycle 1:</h1>
          <h2>Design:</h2>
          <p>To create a biomineralized hard product that could be tested, we designed a mold following ASTM standards for tensile/compressive strength testing with scaled down dimensions. The resulting product had a cross-sectional area of 2 squared, allowing us to later estimate tensile strength.
          </p>

          <h2>Build:</h2>
          <p>We then built a PDMS mold from a 3D printed PETG inverse based on our CAD model, following our protocol “Manufacturing PDMS Channel-Pore Microfluidic Devices.”

          <p>In parallel, we cultured S. pasteurii from glycerol stocks at 30C. Having acquired the appropriate mold, media, and S. pasteurii culture, we began biomineralization, following protocol from Troyer et al. Our three molds, one which was our PDMS mold and the other two which were normal 3D molds, were filled with sand to act as nucleation sites. For one month, we conducted daily interchange between S. pasteurii culture and precipitation media to induce calcite precipitation. </p>
          <h2>Test:</h2>
          <p>Samples were then taken out of molds and sterilized as per our <a href="https://2025.igem.wiki/khanlab-bayarea/experiments">sterilization protocol</a>. We were able to confirm that our protocol successfully sterilized our samples via a swab test. While the process of removing the samples from our molds broke the mineralized material into multiple pieces rendering us unable to measure strength, we can see that the sand has clearly turned into a much more coarse material. </p>

          <h2>Learn:</h2>
          <p>From this process, we learned that fine-grain sand worked best for biomineralization. While creating a biomineralized product, we encountered many contamination issues. Since our S. pasteurii cultures had slower growth rates, any contamination of other bacteria or yeast outcompeted our S. pasteurii cultures. It took us a couple of tries to successfully biomineralize, through which we learned a variety of techniques to ensure maximal sterility, including daily transfer cultures, occasional new S. pasteurii cultures from glycerol stocks, and a healthy dose of paranoia.</p>
